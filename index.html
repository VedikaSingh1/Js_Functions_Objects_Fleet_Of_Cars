      Problem Statement: You are given an array of objects representing a fleet
      of cars.
    </p>
    <p>Each object has the following properties:</p>
    <p>
      - `make` (string): The make of the car (e.g., "Toyota," "Honda," "Ford").
    </p>
    <p>
      - `model` (string): The model of the car (e.g., "Camry," "Civic,"
      "F-150").
    </p>
    <p>- `year` (number): The year the car was manufactured.</p>
    <p>- `mileage` (number): The mileage of the car in miles.</p>
    <br />
    <p>const fleet = [</p>
    <p>{ make: "Toyota", model: "Camry", year: 2019, mileage: 30000 },</p>
    <p>{ make: "Honda", model: "Civic", year: 2018, mileage: 25000 },</p>
    <p>{ make: "Ford", model: "F-150", year: 2020, mileage: 40000 },</p>
    <p>{ make: "Toyota", model: "Corolla", year: 2019, mileage: 28000 },</p>
    <p>{ make: "Honda", model: "Accord", year: 2022, mileage: 15000 }</p>
    <p>];</p>

    <p>
      console.log(getCarMakes(fleet)); // Output: ["Toyota", "Honda", "Ford"]
    </p>
    <p>
      console.log(getCarsWithMileageGreaterThan(fleet, 30000)); // Output: Cars
      with mileage greater than 30000
    </p>
    <p>console.log(sortCarsByYear(fleet)); // Output: Cars sorted by year</p>
    <p>
      console.log(getCarsByMake(fleet, "Toyota")); // Output: Cars by Toyota
    </p>
    <p>
      console.log(getCarMakesWithMultipleModels(fleet)); // Output: ["Toyota",
      "Honda"]
    </p>
    <p>console.log(getNewestCar(fleet)); // Output: Newest car object</p>
